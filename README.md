#Overloading CRUD

This is a simple class designed to illustrate how you can use overloading to accomplish basic CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, and Delete) from a MySQL database.  It will parse a method name and determine what action is to be taken, as well as what the table name and field name to be used are.  This can be very useful for applications where you need to access data in a variety of ways, but you do not want to keep coding methods for every permutation, or 3 or 4 lines of code to query the database everytime.

## Things to Know
> NOTE: This class is not designed as production code, it is merely an illustrative example of what can be done with overloading.  I have not put in any thing to filter input or escape output.  Additionally, it has only been tested with the most basic examples, it is not guaranteed to be bug free. If you have a suggestion for improvement, feel free to send a PR, or log an issue on Github.

* Database Tables must be lowercase, underscore spaced (e.g. `some_table`)
* Database Fields must be lowercase, underscore spaces (e.g. `some_field`)
* Method Names must be set up in camelCase as follows:
	* Create: `insertTableName()`
	* Retrieve: `getTableNameByFieldName()`
	* Update: `updateTableNameByFieldName()`
	* Delete: `deleteTableNameByFieldName()`

## Create
Use a camelCase method name, and pass a single asscoiative array as the parameter.  In the array, the key should be the database field name, and the value is the value to be inserted for that field. The format of the method name is `insertTableName()`

### Example
```
$arrayInsert = array(
	'number' => 12345,
	'name' => 'Joe Smith',
	'email' => 'joe@example.com'
);

$db = new Database();
$result = $db->insertCustomers($arrInsert);

// Returns Number of Rows Inserted
```

## Retrieve
The format of the method name to retrieve a record is `getTableNameByFieldName($value)`.  The where clause of the method will be constructed as `WHERE field_name = '$value'`.  This is meant for relatively simple s`select` queries, so anything more complex would require you to revert to conventional means of building queries.

### Examples
```
$db = new Database();
$result = $db->getCustomersById(5);

/* 
Produces this sql:
"select * from customers where id = '5'"

since this is a single row result you will get an associative array

array(
	'id' => 5,
	'customer_name' => 'Some Customer',
)

a multiple row result would produce a multidimensional array

$result = $db->getCustomersByAccountType('new');
array(
	0 => array('id' => 5, 'customer_name' => 'Some Customer', 'account_type' => 'new'),
	1 => array('id' => 6, 'customer_name' => 'Some Other Customer', 'account_type' => 'new'))
)

*/

```

## Update
This works very similar to retrieval, with one extra parameter which is an array of fields and values to make up the `SET` portion of the sql statement.  The method name format is`updateTableNameByFieldName($whereValue, $arrSet)`

### Example

```
$arrSet = array(
    'customer_name' => 'Updated Customer Name', 
    'account_type' => 'annual'
);

$db = new Database();
$result = $db->updateCustomersById(5, $arrSet);

// returns 1 (number of records affected)
```

## Delete
Works like retrieve and update.  The method name format is `deleteTableNameByFieldName($value)`.  

###Example

```
$db = new Database();
$result = $db->deleteCustomersById(5);

// returns 1 (number of affected rows)

```

## Change Log
* 3/6/13 [nyamsprod] : Make the code more robust, adding dependency injection & sql injection prevention
